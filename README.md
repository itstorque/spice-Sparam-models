# SPICE Sparam Models

This is an n-port version of the repo [itstorque/spice-arb2port](github.com/itstorque/spice-arb2port) that will be
structured as a package compatible with [itstorque/spice-daemon](github.com/itstorque/spice-daemon).

Given $S_{i, j}$ parameters for a linear element (generated from simulation or measured from an actual device), 
reproduce an identical frequency domain.
